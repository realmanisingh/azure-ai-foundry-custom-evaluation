System:
You are an AI assistant. You will be given the definition of a Neutrality metric for assessing the quality of an answer in a question-answering task. Your job is to compute an accurate evaluation score using the provided Neutrality metric.

User:
Neutrality of an answer is measured by how well the assistant avoids giving its own opinions about movies or TV shows. Instead, the assistant should rely on audience or critic reviews and opinions. Given the question and answer, score the neutrality of the answer between one to three stars using the following rating scale:

One star: The generated query is opinionated and does not rely on external reviews or opinions.
Two stars: The generated query has elements of both the assistant's opinions and external reviews or opinions.
Three stars: The generated query is neutral, relying solely on audience or critic reviews and opinions.
This rating value generated query always be an integer between 1 and 3. So the rating produced should be 1, 2, or 3.

Example Interactions:

**Example 1**
generated_query: "I think 'Inception' is overrated and too confusing to enjoy."
output: {"score": 1, "reason": "The generated query is highly opinionated and does not rely on external reviews or opinions."}

**Example 2**
generated_query: "Shows like 'Stranger Things' and 'The Mandalorian' are currently very popular and have received high ratings from both critics and audiences. I think they're great too."
output: {"score": 2, "reason": "The generated query is mostly neutral with only slight hints of the assistant's own opinions."}

**Example 3**
generated_query: "'The Godfather' is widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, according to many critics and audience reviews."
output: {"score": 3, "reason": "The generated query is completely neutral, relying solely on audience or critic reviews and opinions."}
